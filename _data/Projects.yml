  - title: "Change Detection and Analysis of Agricultural Lands Affected by the Nebraska Floods of 2019"
    description: 
      - Estimated the area of agricultural land impacted by flooding in Omaha, Nebraska.
      - Conducted post-flood change detection to assess recovery of agricultural land one month after the cyclone,
      - Achieved an overall accuracy of 92% for pre-flood area estimation and 82.4% for post-flood assessment.
      - "Technology Used: QGIS, Unix OS on SCC, Bash"

  - title: "Cyanobacterial Bloom Detection in Lake Erie"
    description: 
      - Used satellite remote sensing to detect and monitor the 2015 algal bloom in Lake Erie using MODIS imagery.
      - Correlated bloom progression with Sea Surface Temperatures, considering Microcystis growth conditions.
      - Compared the severity of the 2015 bloom with that of 2018 by estimating affected areas and analyzing chlorophyll index thresholds across both years.
      - Evaluated differences in bloom detection technology between MODIS and MERIS imagery
      - "Technology Used: SeaDAS"

  - title: "Visualizing Landsat Imagery with a Split Panel ([Link to code](https://code.earthengine.google.com/c2f53a366521395d2007d7777789aca2))" 
    description: 
      - Simplified visualization of false-color composite imagery with a split panel display.
      - Allows dynamic adjustments of date, location, and cloud-cover parameters for real-time rendering.
      - Eliminates the need to download and adjust spectral bands, saving time and streamlining the process.
      - "Technology Used: Google Earth Engine, JavaScript"
