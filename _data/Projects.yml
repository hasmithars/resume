  - title: "Change Detection and Analysis of Agricultural Lands Affected by the Nebraska Floods of 2019"
    description: 
      - Estimated the area of agricultural land impacted by flooding in Omaha, Nebraska.
      - Conducted post-flood change detection to assess recovery of agricultural land one month after the cyclone,
      - Achieved an overall accuracy of 92% for pre-flood area estimation and 82.4% for post-flood assessment.
      - "Technology Used: QGIS, Unix OS on SCC, Bash"

  - title: "Cyanobacterial Bloom Detection in Lake Erie"
    description: 
      - Used satellite remote sensing to detect and monitor the 2015 algal bloom in Lake Erie using MODIS imagery.
      - Correlated bloom progression with Sea Surface Temperatures, considering Microcystis growth conditions.
      - Compared the severity of the 2015 bloom with that of 2018 by estimating affected areas and analyzing chlorophyll index thresholds across both years.
      - Evaluated differences in bloom detection technology between MODIS and MERIS imagery
      - "Technology Used: SeaDAS"
