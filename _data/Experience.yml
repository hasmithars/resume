    description:
      - _Project Management_
      - Led end-to-end delivery of 17 geospatial and remote sensing projects, overseeing client onboarding, project scoping, timeline management, deliverable tracking, and feedback integration.
      - Facilitated regular stakeholder engagement through monthly and bi-monthly update meetings, ensuring alignment on KPIs and strategic objectives.
      - Managed cross-functional coordination with the imagery acquisition team to support satellite tasking and data procurement for 20+ project AOIs, including continuous monitoring for time-sensitive operations.
      - Partnered with R&D to conceptualize, prototype, and deploy custom geospatial algorithms tailored to the energy, utilities, and pipeline sectors, directly addressing client-specific challenges.
      - Optimized the transition workflow between sales and project execution, improving cross-team communication and reducing onboarding time by streamlining responsibilities and documentation for the whole team.
      - _Remote Sensing & GIS_
      - Designed an impervious surface mapping workflow with 95% accuracy using Python and Claude Sonnet, incorporating feature engineering of various spectral indices and prompt engineering for optimized AI interpretation of Pleiades imagery, supporting federally mandated utility reporting.
      - Processed and analyzed high-resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-3, Pleiades, PlanetScope) for 30+ LULC assessments, applying advanced classification and change detection techniques.
      - Developed an automated methane alert extraction pipeline that integrated atmospheric data to calculate flow ratesâ€”adopted by the R&D team for operational scaling.
      - Engineered a GIS-based asset conflation workflow for a utility client in Indiana, directly leading to a $60K follow-on engagement.
      - Re-architected the GIS relational database with a hierarchical structure, significantly improving data retrieval efficiency and archival access.
      - _Training_
      - Conducted over 40 technical training sessions (3+ hours each) on advanced geospatial and remote sensing workflows for audiences ranging from entry-level hires to external clients.
      - Authored 20+ onboarding guides and SOPs, including detailed workflow diagrams using MS Visio, covering project management processes and geospatial analysis best practices.

    role: Research Assistant
    description: 
      - _NASA ROSES Grant_
      - Provided remote sensing and GIS support to a land cover land use change project comparing the effectiveness of conservation instruments in threatened forest habitat in the Colombian Andes.
      - Collected over 8000 training data points and performed land cover/classification validation of over 600 land parcels.
      - _USGS Grant_
      - Lead researcher to develop an algorithm for automated mapping of 17 ecosystem types in the Peruvian Amazon in collaboration with scientists at IIAP, Peru.
      - Designed an algorithm for extracting satellite imagery, deriving spatial-temporal metrics, performing image classification and assessing accuracy through a confusion matrix using Google Earth Engine.
